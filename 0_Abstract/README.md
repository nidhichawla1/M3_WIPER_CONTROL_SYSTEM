# Abstract
Mary Anderson, patented the first windshield wiper in 1903 andwitnessed the streetcar operator labouring with extremely poor visibility while riding a streetcar in New York City ,he immediately started designing a windshield wiper that the driver might use to aid enhance visibility.This manual mechanism used a lever to control a series of wood and rubber arms that helped clear snow, rain, and debris.
Windshield wipers were not standard equipment on most vehicles until 1916, allowing for further technological developments. In 1919, inventor William M. Folberth developed the first automatic, non-hand-driven windshield wipers. 
Until the 1960s, when intermittent wipers became more widespread, this vacuum-powered technology was extensively utilized,  thanks to Robert Kearns, an engineering professor whose concept actually took root. When Kearns proposed manufacturing the idea, he brought it to the attention of Ford Motor Company. While this concept contributed to the development of windshield wipers.
Windshield wipers are now standard equipment on most automobiles, with a number of alternatives available. Rain-sensing wipers that start themselves have even been introduced by the automotive sector. With this technology, the road view will always be clear.
In this project, Iâ€™m trying to enact the WIPER CONTROL SYSTEM with the help of 4 componets along with their functionalities listed below:\
Ignition Key Position at ACC: The Red LED is ON, if the user button is pressed and held for 2 secs\
Wiper ON: Wiper is OFF: On press of the user input, Blue, Green and Orange LEDs come ON one at a time with the set frequency, The frequency changes on every alternate key press, 3 frequency levels with 1, 4 and 8 Hz\
Wiper OFF: Wiper is ON: The LED glow pattern stops on the 4th press; the wiper action starts next press onwards as mentioned in step 2\
Ignition Key Position at Lock: The Red LED is OFF, if the user button is pressed and held for 2 secs.
