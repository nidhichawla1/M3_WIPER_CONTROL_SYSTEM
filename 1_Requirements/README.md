# Requirement Analysis
This section details the initial requirement analysis findings. We will use 5Ws framework and SWOT analysis technique to assess the business need and requirements.

5Ws and H Framework
•	Who are we trying to help?
People to get better technology based wiper system.\
•	What is your Product Vision?
Vision of our project is to enact the wiper control system with the help of 4 Led’s and a push botton. will help the user in obstacle detection. I’ve tried to implement the motion of wiper at e different speeds with the help of 3 Led’s blinking at 3 different frequencies at the press of a push button. 4th Led is dedicated to show the Ignition Key Position at ACC and the same is used to show Ignition Key Position at Lock after the wiper motion at 3 different frequencies.\
•	Where should we start?
Government organizations are the best places to start with.\
•	Why will we succeed?
Our products accuracy and effectiveness are the factors which differentiate us from other solutions already existing in the market.\
•	When should we launch?
The launch should be done immediately as it is necessary to assess public awareness to avoid the helplessness.\
•	How will we do it?
We will use embedded C language for the coding part and microcontroller STM32 for designing of the circuit.
